# Data-Science-Dashboard-using-Streamlit
In this project, I used an dataset of Tweets on US Airlines from Kaggle and perform a Sentiment analysis on it or try to showcase on WebApp using Streamlit framework. On the WebApp you can see the location of positive, negative and neutral tweets on US airlines by people in the world map. I used an Plotly tool for the Visualization and also build a Word Cloud of Tweets.

To run in your local system, install the required packages from `requirements.txt` file (use command pip install -r requirements.txt) and run the below command

You can see the working of the WebApp [here](https://data-science-project-dashboard.herokuapp.com/).
